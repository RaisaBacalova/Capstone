LIST OF ACHIEVEMENTS

Fundamentals.
1. Scaling - 100	The player feels small compared with the meteors or planets
2. Animation - 100	The player's ship constantly moving forward
3. Lighting - 100	I used a directional light to add visibility to the planets and shininess to the meteors, especially golden ones
4. Locomotion - 100	Use of accelerometer 
5. Physics - 100	Adding a kinematic rigidbody to the player to collide with other objects and disable the gravity

Completeness
1.Gamification - 250	Adding a reward system for hitting golden meteors
2.Diegetic UI - 250	Using voice recording which briefly explains the rules of the game (Scene scene, on start), adding a pictute of gold instead of writhing "Your score" on a score board (Level1 scene)

Challenges
1. User testing - 500		The user testing document is attached
2. Compute shader - 500		The player, tunnel and menu panel have shaders on them which I recently wrote, and made them my favourite for this moment at least.
